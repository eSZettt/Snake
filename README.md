Snake
=====

Old Snake game I made during free time in my AP CS class last year.
Really just needed something to throw up on my Github.
Feel free to suggest changes, some of the coding is pretty sloppy, really just wanted to make it all work.
Learned a lot about JFrames vs JPanels, and I've learned more sense. Might re-work a couple things at some point.
Reported issues are greatly appreciated so I know where to focus my efforts.
